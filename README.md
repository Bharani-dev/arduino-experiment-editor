# Arduino Experiment Editor

A web-based, open-source Arduino experiment editor that allows users to visually build simple Arduino circuits using drag-and-drop components, automatic wiring, and real-time Arduino code generation.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop Arduino Uno, LED, and Push Button components
- Visual wiring between components and Arduino digital pins
- Automatic pin assignment to avoid conflicts
- Real-time Arduino C/C++ code generation
- Basic visual simulation (Button → LED)
- Runs entirely in a web browser
- No proprietary software or libraries required

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Drag components from the left panel onto the canvas
4. Connect components to Arduino pins
5. View the generated Arduino code in the Code View
6. Start simulation to test basic functionality

## Open Source Hardware (OSHW)
